# EE301FZ Deep ResNet for TSDS research
This Work has proposed a deep residual neural network (RNN) model for traffic signs detection system (TSDS) research. Experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of implement RNN model for traffic sign detection and recognition. 

Moreover, a new systematic analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method for model performance evaluation have been suggested, which is sufficient for deployment in the practical performance measurement of deep learning model.
